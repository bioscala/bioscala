The goal of the BioScala project is to create a scalable and functional
bioinformatics library, building on existing libraries available on the JAVA
Virtual Machine (JVM) - including BioJAVA and BioRuby.

This is the place for the BioScala project under the liberal BSD license. 

This edition of BioScala has:

  - Strongly typed DNA, RNA Sequence, gapped and IUPAC ambiguous Sequence
  - Sequences contain lists of Nucleotide, AminoAcid, IUPAC, Gapped, Codon
  - Flexible Sequence user defined attributes
  - Transcription of DNA to RNA
  - Translation of (ambiguous) RNA to AA (using BioJava3)
	- Iterator based FASTA file format reader
  - Iterator based (PAML) Phylip file format reader
  - Phylip reader/writer (using BioJava)
  - Alignments and attributes (work in progress)
  - A translation example of calling into BioRuby
  - A tutorial in ./doc/tutorial.txt

BioScala uses the simple build tool (sbt) and behaviour driven development/unit
testing.
