= Designing the BioScala library =

Scala is a strongly typed functional language, that allows for object
oriented programming (OOP). Too functional purists this is something
of a contradiction.  However, it does make sense for complex libraries
- OOP allows for partitioning of data and code.

Designing a library from scratch is a good opportunity to make
fundamental choices. OOP can easily be driven too far and can make
hierarchies of objects hard to maintain. With BioScala we opt for a
functional approach:

  BioScala aims for functional programming

OOP is used in the most minimalistic fashion to partition
functionality.

  BioScala uses OOP in a minimalistic fashion

Maybe an example will help. With functional programming we emphasize
immutable values and no side effects. We also design functions in a
way that they use '''basic''' objects, when possible.

So, it makes sense to have a Nucleotide class - which allows for
strong type checking. A Sequence has a list of nucleotides and a list
of attributes, like ID and descriptions.

Now we are to add transcription. Should it be part of the Sequence
class? In classic OOP design: yes. However, with BioScala we don't
think transcription is a part of a Sequence object. Rather than
cluttering Sequence - which is an object - we create a
SequenceTranslation object, which carries no state. The translate
method is without side effects. It takes as input a list of
nucleotide, and returns a fresh transcribed list of nucleotides.

For convenience we add a transcribe method to Sequence, which
delegates to the new function. Someone may wish to say
'seq.transcribe' - it should return a new transcribed Sequence. At
least, when there is a reason to, for example a deeper copy happens
of, for example, attributes. The rule is:

  A function should return the minimum complexity of objects (without
  losing information)

The main difference with a traditional OOP delegator pattern, like you
would write in Ruby or JAVA, is that the list of nucleotides get
passed to the function, as input. Traditionally a Sequence object
would be passed in.

What is the advantage? First, SequenceTranslation is not aware about
Sequence objects. So you can create an alternative implementation
easily. Second, the transcribe method is cleaner - it does not refer
to Sequence object internals.

== FastaReader

A similar example is FastaReader. Compare the BioScala implementation
with the current one in BioJAVA. In BioJAVA the FastaReader takes care
of reading a FASTA file, transforming it to BioJAVA Sequence objects
in ''memory'', and returns the type automatically (DNA, RNA,
Protein). It looks very attractive, as it takes care of everything.
However, it is not a flexible approach.

The BioScala FastaReader, in contrast, does very little. The FASTA
file is iterated, returning a Tuple every time. The tuple consists of
the record ID, description and sequence - as Strings. We can assume
that is the minimal layout of a FASTA record. Even if we no nothing of
the content.  The only state contained in the FastaReader object is the file
handle. You can use the same FastaReader for nucteotides, amino
acids, alignments, degenerated data etc.

FastaReader makes no real ''assumptions'' on the content of the FASTA
file.  It only split out records, based on lines starting with '>'.
And it splits out the ID from the description. If you encounter some
dirty file you can easily clean it up by filtering on the data, before
passing it into the Sequence object(s). Also it is trivially simple to
plug in a new implementation of a FastaReader.

FastaReader does not load everything in memory.

  BioScala does not read files in memory

Reading files in RAM is a big NO, in this age of Big Data.

== Support for ambiguous nucleotides ==

BioScala has several nucleotide classes which support data that is
pure (AGCT only), gapped (adds '-'), or has ambigous data like IUPAC.
If you use DNA.IUPACSequence over DNA.Sequence, you'll get type
checking for IUPAC. 

bio.Sequence[T] is the abstract base class for all Sequences.
DNA.Sequence supports Nucleotide - so only AGCT values.
DNA.IPACSequence supports IUPAC. And IUPACGappedSequence adds gaps. 
The design is similar for RNA and Protein sequences. Protein contains
support for Amino Acid and Codon type Sequences. CodonSequence
supports the widest definition of a Sequence (IUPAC and Gaps).

Support for translation etc. is mixed into the Sequence types.

The current implementation is somewhat inheritance based - mixed
traits may be a later improvement.

== Alignment ==

Alignments contain a list of Sequences. Each Sequence stores a list of:

  Nucleotide | Gap
  AminoAcid | Gap
  Codon | Gap

Where Gap is a bio.Symbol and Codon is an amino acid with matching
codon sequence. One way to handle it is to store a List[Symbol] that
supports a Gap and one of the other types in, for example,
GappedSequence[Codon]. The type safety is not really maintained at the
lowest level - as it is storing two different types. Still, the higher
interface, which constructs the Sequences, can be type safe.

Maybe we should support special IUPAC Gap types.  More complex Gaps can
store information as attributes, so we can do with a single symbol,
the dash. Thus the single types

  DNA.GappedIUPAC for DNA.GappedSequence
  Protein.GappedIUPAC for Protein.GappedSequence
  GappedCodon for GappedCodonSequence

and also

  DNA.GappedNucleotide for DNA.Sequence
  Protein.GappedAminoAcid for Protein.Sequence

are type safe. This implies that for these symbols we can safely use
the base abstract class bio.Sequence[T], rather than having a
specialised class.

Gapped Sequences share traits. One of them is to split the Sequence
into gapped and non-gapped sections. This functionality goes into
the RichGappedSequence trait.

== Generic functions ==

To enforce type safety we end up with different lists of Symbols
having a similar meaning. For example Protein.Gap and Nucleotide.Gap
are really different alignment spacing objects.

We could create different implementations for each type, to ensure
type safety. Still the whole point of writing functional code is to
write code once. So how do we do it with Scala?

Let's say we want to split a Sequence into gapped and non-gapped
sections. We want to write something like:

    def sections(seq: List[Symbol], gap: Symbol): List[List[Symbol]] = {
      def isMatch(inGapped: Boolean, c: Symbol) = {
        if (inGapped) 
          c == gap
        else
          c != gap
      }
      val isGap = (seq(0) == gap)
      val s = seq.takeWhile{ isMatch(isGap,_) }
      val tail = seq.takeRight(seq.length - s.length)
      tail match {
        case Nil => s :: Nil
        case _   => s :: sections(tail, gap)
      }
    }

the problem is - what type is gap? As it is an object we can pass it
in from the start:

  sections(seq, gap) ...

which would work fine. However, we may not want to make this exception
every time.

In many cases I have seen a solution which gives the object a query
method, like isGap? So a that Gap symbol returns True, and a non-gap
returns False. This is an often seen OOP solution. The main issue I
have with it is that object become unneccessarily 'rich'. Besides,
why should an Amino Acid object care whether it is a gap (or not)?

Similarly 'properties' are added, like isGap (true or false). This is
seen in non-OOP languages, like in the EMBOSS C code. This way you
end up with a long list of (sometimes conflicting!) properties.

Dynamic languages, like Python and Ruby, but in this case also Java,
allow for querying the name of the object's class. Thus, one can
check whether it is a gap, or not, by quering the name of the object.
This is nicer - and one reason you get more compact class libraries
with Ruby. In the same vein you could use method_missing? to query for
an isGap? method, in Ruby. Saving sprinkling Gap knowlegde over the
object hierarchy.

For me, being new to Scala, I confront myself with this issue. Apart
from passing in the Gap object, Scala allows the OOP solution (a
method, or property for every object), and we can query the class name
(Java style). My gut says there should be a better way.

The solution is a class using generics, and som lower bound typing on
functions. I blogged about the different options, starting at
http://blog.thebird.nl/?p=37. 

The final solution reads something like

    class Splitter[T] {
      def section(seq: List[T]): List[List[T]] = {
        def isGapType[Q >: T](c : Q) = (c == DNA.Gap || c == Protein.Gap)
        def isMatch(c : T) = { if (isGapType(seq(0))) isGapType(c) else !isGapType(c) }
        val (s, tail) = seq.span{ isMatch }
        tail match {
          case Nil => s :: Nil
          case _   => s :: section(tail)
        }
      }
    }

with the matching Specification:

    "section" should "split on Nucleotide" in {
      new Splitter[Nucleotide].section(List(A,G,Gap,Gap,C,T,Gap,T)) should equal (List(List(A,G),List(Gap,Gap),List(C,T),List(Gap),List(T)))
    }

Basically we can write the function once, so its implementation gets
shared between different types - in a type safe way. We can even hide
the type specification by adding in the bio.DNA and bio.Protein packages:

    type UseSymbol = Nucleotide
    object MySplitter extends Splitter8[UseSymbol]

and

    "section" should "split on Nucleotide" in {
      MySplitter.section(List(A,G,Gap,Gap,C,T,Gap,T)) should equal (List(List(A,G),List(Gap,Gap),List(C,T),List(Gap),List(T)))
    }
